# Inception Project Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Inception Project**, the next step following the born2beRoot program, designed to introduce you to the world of Docker. This project is a deep dive into Docker technology and requires a considerable amount of learning and experimentation.

## Project Approach
Given the complexity and the learning curve associated with Docker, this project demands extensive research and practice. Here are some recommended steps to guide you through the project:

### Recommended Learning Path
1. **Familiarize with Docker**:
   - Start by learning the basics of Docker.
   - Practice running Docker containers and setting up Docker Compose.

2. **Nginx**:
   - Understand how to set up and configure Nginx within your Docker environment.

3. **MariaDB**:
   - Learn how to configure MariaDB during the Docker build process.
   - Practice connecting to the database and navigating through it using the terminal.

4. **WordPress**:
   - Focus on installing WordPress through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Parallel Project Execution
Due to the project's demanding nature, it's advisable to work on it **in parallel with other projects**. This approach helps prevent feelings of overwhelm and allows for a more balanced learning experience.

### Practical Tips
- **Use Pre-Configured Containers**: When configuring a specific service, start with a well-established container. This strategy ensures that any issues you encounter are related to the service you're building, simplifying troubleshooting.
- **Never push** a '.env' file. This file is suppose to contain very sensitive information like password. However, you can push a '.env.template' who will advice the user that pull your project to understand wich variable he must set to make it work.

## Long-Term Benefits
Mastering this project not only equips you with Docker expertise but also lays a strong foundation for future projects like **Transcendance** and potentially the **Micro-Service module**.

## Conclusion
The Inception project is challenging yet rewarding, offering a profound understanding of Docker and its applications. By following this guide and utilizing the recommended resources and strategies, you'll be well-equipped to tackle this project and subsequent advanced topics.
